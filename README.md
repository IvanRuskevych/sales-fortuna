architecture for scalable and maintainable code organization.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- React 19
- TypeScript
- Vite — fast development environment
- Swiper — for slider/carousel functionality
- FSD (Feature-Sliced Design) — modular project structure
- SASS — for styling
- ESLint — for code linting
- Cloudinary — image hosting

## 📁 Project Structure (FSD)

The project follows the FSD (Feature-Sliced Design) structure:

- `entities/` — core reusable entities
- `features/` — individual logic or business features
- `shared/` — common components, styles, helpers
- `widgets/` — composable UI blocks (e.g., testimonial slider)
- `pages/` — application pages

This modular design improves maintainability and scalability.
